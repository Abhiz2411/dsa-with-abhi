## 1. Basic Input and Output in Java

Input and output operations enable Java programs to interact with users, making it possible to create user-friendly applications with graphical interfaces or command-line interfaces. Input allows programs to obtain data from various sources, such as users, files, or external devices. This data can be used for processing, analysis, or storage. Whereas, output enables programs to present results or information to users in a readable and meaningful format. This is essential for displaying data, reports, or graphical visualizations.

Java offers two input methods, Scanner and BufferedReader, to cater to diverse programming needs. Scanner simplifies console input for common use cases, providing easy-to-use methods for various data types. BufferedReader, on the other hand, offers greater control and efficiency, making it suitable for complex input scenarios and handling large volumes of data, such as reading from files or network streams. 

### Including Libraries

Java is a versatile language, that relies on libraries to access various functionalities. To perform tasks like input and output, we include specific libraries at the beginning of our code. One such essential library is java.util, which includes the Scanner class. The Scanner class is a workhorse for handling user input, allowing you to effortlessly read data from the keyboard or other sources.
